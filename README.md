# XCTestPlayground

This repository contains a simple implementation of most `XCTAssert` macros to use in a Playground.

With the Playground feature that display the result of an executed line, it will show the assert result like this:

I use this to do TDD directly inside a Playground and then move the code as-is inside my test files.

It contains a `XCTestCase` base class that, when instantiated, will run all methods with names beginning with "test", to mimic XCTestCase behaviour and make moving the code to your Xcode project easier.

## How to install it in an existing playground

Simply add the `XCTestPlayground.swift` file to your Playground `Sources` folder.

## Using it directly

The repo contains a fully configured Xcode workspace containing a playground importing `XCTestPlayground`.
All you have to do is:

1. clone the repo
2. build the framework on a 64-bit target (e.g. iPhone 5s simulator)
3. go and play in the `XCTestPlaygroundExample` playground! ðŸŽ‰
